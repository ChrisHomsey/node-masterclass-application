# Node Masterclass Application

This is my current progress on the main application excercise of the Pirple Node Masterclass sections 1-3.

The application being built is a web app that allows users to authenticate, login using tokens, set up "up-time" checks to their favorite websites, and then receive notifications via SMS using the Twilio API.
